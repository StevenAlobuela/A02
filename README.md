In order to use Git, you have to download it on your operating system at the Git website. Then you have to configure git and open your terminal and set up your username and password. From there, you go to the GitHub website and create an account. After you have created the account, you must create repository and then clone it. You must then get familiar with many of the git commands in order to be able to use GitHub effectively. WebStorm is an IDE used for web development. You have to make an account on JetBrains and then you are able to install it on your operating system. To get started, you have to create a new project and then get familiar with the set up and the code. This will help you get a better understanding of application and make it easier to navigate through the app.
