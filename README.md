In order to use Git, you have to download it on your operating system at the Git website. Then you have to configure git and open your terminal and set up your username and password. From there, you go to the GitHub website and create an account. After you have created the account, you must create repository and then clone it. You must then get familiar with many of the git commands in order to be able to use GitHub effectively.
